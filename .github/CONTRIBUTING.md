# Contributing to CRSF for Arduino

Thank you for helping to make CRSF for Arduino better.
Before you can go Gung Ho on coding, there are a few house rules I need you to familiarise yourself with.

## Do's & don'ts of CRSF for Arduino

### **Do...**

1. Read the README in its entirety _before_ submitting an issue, as your "bug" may very well be a case of PICNIC.
2. Respond in a timely and respectful manner.
3. If something isn't working, please provide evidence - EG Screenshots of compiler errors.
4. Provide concise details.
5. Use the Discussions tab for things are not Issues or Pull Requests, but are still relevant to CRSF for Arduino.
6. Format your code. CRSF for Arduino uses clang-format as a formatter. So, use that if you actually want to contribute to CRSF for Arduino's development.

### **Don't...**

1. Use CRSF for Arduino on incompatible hardware & write me an issue about "strange behaviour".
2. Ghost me for more than 14 consecutive days.
3. Write things like "This isn't working" & refuse to provide any information &/or context beyond that.
4. Write walls of text. Do this & watch how quickly I mark your issue as "TL;DR" & close it without any response from me.
5. Beg for updates. Please don't do this. If you do, I will intentionally take longer to release said update to spite you.
6. Assume that the project is "dead" after any significant amount of time has passed.

## A few notable points

- CRSF for Arduino requires _all_ commits to be properly signed/verfied. Pull Requests that have unverified commits will not be accepted.
- Not every Pull Request can/will be accepted. Simply because you submitted it, that doesn't automatically guarantee that your Pull Request will be merged.
- With the above rule being said... I reserve the right to decline any Pull Request if I deem it necessary to do so. I also reserve the right to decline a Pull Request with or without providing a reason to do so (even though I prefer to tell you why it was declined).
- All Pull Requests to the Main-Trunk must be reviewed before they can be merged. If I suggest to you to make changes to your Pull Request, don't fight me on it. I already have a reason why those changes need to be made (& I already would have told you what that reason is).
- I have a few GitHub Actions automations that need to pass, before your Pull Request can be merged.
